    - title: Software Engineer Intern - AI/ML
      institution: Juniper Networks, Sunnyvale, CA
      year: Jun 2024 - Present
      description:
        - AI powered traffic generator - Designing an AI-powered system that converts natural language prompts into realistic GPU datacenter traffic patterns for testing network switches in simulation.
    - title: Senior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer
      institution: American Express Company, Gurgaon, India
      year: Feb 2022 - Aug 2024
      description:
        - LLM fine-tuning and optimization for retrieval-augmented generation based Q&A systems, enabling marketing teams to efficiently query marketing plans, promotions and executive summaries. Implemented quantization and pruning, reducing computational costs by 35%.
        - Worked with AmEx AI Labs to build a customer complaints segmentation model using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERT embeddings, reducing complaints response time by 75%.
        - Designed Marketing Mix Models (MMM) to analyze $60M+ in media ad spend, influencing C-level decisions on ad strategy. Led to 2x increase in media budgets, and investment reduction in inefficient channels.
        - Modernized MMM using Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to incorporate prior beliefs and quantify uncertainty in the model. Reduced manual intervention and model runtime by 60%.
        - Developed models to quantify ad saturation, enabling marketing teams to simulate budget allocation scenarios and optimize spend.
        - Selected for a high-potential leadership program, leading a team of two analysts during manager's maternity leave.
    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: American Express Company, Gurgaon, India
      year: Jun 2019 - Jan 2022
      description:
        - Generated actionable insights for referral digital marketing channels for a $4B+ annual business, across product, ad placement, financial, and demographic data to refine marketing strategies and boost ROI.
        - Built a predictive model using xGBoost to identify high-potential referrers from existing customers, enabling better-targeted marketing, reducing ad spend, and driving $10M+ in incremental revenue.
        - Designed and executed A/B test for referral marketing campaigns, resulting in at least $15M+ uplift in conversion rates across UK, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia markets.
        - Identified user personas from clickstream patterns using K-Means clustering, enabling persona-driven landing pages and offers, which improved conversion rates by 7%.
        - Built a customer segmentation model using K-Means clustering, leveraging clickstream and behavioral data to optimize retargeting campaigns and improve conversion rates by 12%.
        - Built scalable ETL pipelines using Apache Spark, ensuring efficient processing of referral and clickstream data.
        - Designed and implemented containerised solutions using Docker, orchestrated microservices architectures with Kubernetes, and integrated CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployments.
