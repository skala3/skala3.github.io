<p align="justify">
I am a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at the <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. I am passionate about machine learning, data science, and building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Currently, I work as a Software Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.juniper.net/">Juniper Networks</a>, where I am designing an AI-powered system that converts natural language prompts into realistic GPU datacenter traffic patterns for testing network switches in simulation.
</p>

<p align="justify">
My research interests include causal inference, deep learning on graph-structured data, and applications of machine learning in networking and systems. At UCSD, I have worked on projects involving causal copilot agents and predicting intelligence from fMRI data using Graph Neural Networks.
</p>

Previously, I worked as a Senior Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/">American Express</a>, where I focused on LLM fine-tuning, Marketing Mix Modeling using Bayesian inference, and building customer segmentation models. My work contributed to optimizing $60M+ in media ad spend and driving significant business impact.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I hold expertise in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and cloud technologies. I'm particularly interested in Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems, and applying machine learning to improve business outcomes and system performance.
